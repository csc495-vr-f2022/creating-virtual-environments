# Creating Virtual Environments

## Topics

1. Helpful tips
   - Searching for imports
   - Using the console log
2. Importing and converting 3D models 
   - [Dragonite 3D model](https://clara.io/view/5cf54194-6b42-4d1e-bfc3-4fff1f89287c#) from Clara.io
3. Exporting scene assets from Unity
   - [RPG Poly Pack - Lite](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/rpg-poly-pack-lite-148410) from the Unity Asset Store
   - You will need to build the [UnityGLTF plugin](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/UnityGLTF) from source if you are using a platform other than Windows.
4. Automated deployment to the web
   - Note that you will need to modify the `deploy.sh` script with your information before it will work.

## Participation Exercise

Modify the existing scene by moving at least three mesh objects loaded in `world.glb`.  To do this, you should use the debug inspector to find the node names and determine new position/rotation/scale values to use in your code.  You should submit the modified `index.ts` file on Canvas (do not include any other files).
